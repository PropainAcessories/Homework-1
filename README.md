# Homework-1
I changed many of the HTML tags to semantic ones to clean up the document slightly. I mostly left the HTML alone structure-wise.
I added a comment before Linking the external .CSS file. I also deleted the project README.md file to make the repository appear cleaner; as well as cutting down on the number of folders.
I had to change the div element to section in the stylesheet in order to get things to work; and I added comments to the stylesheet as well.
I used the Accessability tab on the developer tools in Chrome and to the best of my knowledge every element was highlighted green when I checked.
